# School_District_Analysis
Using Python within an Anaconda dev environment
## Overview
Not all data sets come with impeccable integrity. In this challenge, we have been informed that the data sets we are using to analyze student performance within PyCitySchools have been tampered with. We will be helping Maria, who has been employed by the school board as a data scientist, with removing the compromised data. We will then identify the differences between our analysis before and after cleaning the data.
